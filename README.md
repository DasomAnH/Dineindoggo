API King: Pete Looney
Empress of Buttons: Kate Frain
CSS QUEEN: Dasom

-Pete wrote a function to utilize the Google Place API to allow users to search dog-friendly restaurants, isolating 'dog-friendly' by parsing reviews for keywords
-Kate integrated the API calls with our html via render strings
-Dasom made everything gorgeous via CSS
-Team members worked together to make Dog CEO API return random dog pictures if users submitted unsupported file types to the About Me section

-Apparently we need to give credit to font awesome for using their dog icon, and provide a link to their license. Below is an example of that:
Dog Icon: Font Awesome, all right reserved.
