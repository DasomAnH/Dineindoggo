in this edit I changed: 
-added bootstrap CSS
-connected JS files to pages
-created filler HTML

-Apparently we need to give credit to font awesome for using their dog icon, and provide a link to their license. Below is an example of that:
Dog Icon: Font Awesome, all right reserved.
License: https://fontawesome.com/license
